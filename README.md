# Natural Language to SQL Query Converter

This is a full stack app that converts natural language English to SQL queries using OpenAI's GPT-3.5 architecture and text completion API. The app has a client and a server, each with its own npm packages. 

The tutorial to build this application is [on youtube](https://youtu.be/kjUSOa_KOts).

## Getting Started
